;;; Code:

;; Set the default face. The default face is the basis for most other
;; faces used in Emacs. A "face" is a configuration including font,
;; font size, foreground and background colors and other attributes.
;; The fixed-pitch and fixed-pitch-serif faces are monospace faces
;; generally used as the default face for code. The variable-pitch
;; face is used when `variable-pitch-mode' is turned on, generally
;; whenever a non-monospace face is preferred.

;; Themes are color customization packages which coordinate the
;; various colors, and in some cases, font-sizes for various aspects
;; of text editing within Emacs, toolbars, tabbars and
;; modeline. Several themes are built-in to Emacs, by default,
;; Crafted Emacs uses the `deeper-blue' theme. Here is an example of
;; loading a different theme from the venerable Doom Emacs project.

(crafted-package-install-package 'doom-themes)
(progn
  (disable-theme 'deeper-blue)          ; first turn off the deeper-blue theme
  (load-theme 'doom-palenight t))       ; load the doom-palenight theme

;; Use a nice dark theme
;; (crafted-package-install-package 'modus-themes)
;; (progn
;;   (disable-theme 'deeper-blue)
;;   (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t))

;; On a Mac, fonts can be found in the FontBook app
